TODO (in rough order):
have output being the action space (done)
change it to memory buffers (done)]
stop illegal moves (done)
stop weights increasing too much (done I think)
add convolutional networks (done)

Add learning rate
add target network
add prioritized experience replay
save models (done)
Think about evalution of models
add dropout layers (maybe?)

#add higher order logic on self play (MCTS)
change from q learning to something else (td lambda? n step tree backup?)
convert everything to tensor before it hits networK???????????????
